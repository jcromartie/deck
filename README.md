# deck

Data is music to your ears.

![an old school tape deck](http://jcromartie.github.com/deck/images/deck.jpg)

You think it would be pretty neat if you could just record everything
and and play it back later, but it would be even better if you could
remix it on the fly.

Well, now you can (and pretty easily if you ask me).

deck is designed to record and replay *events* on a piece of state.

Those events are appended to a file on disk

## Usage

Include deck as a dependency in your Leiningen `project.clj` with:

    [deck "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]

To use deck, you just give it a path to store events in, some initial
state, and a function that updates your data model's state by applying
events.

    user=> (require '[deck.core :as deck])
    user=> (def db (deck/deck "./datastore" {} handle-event))
    
    ;; P.S. handle-event should be a function of two arguments: the current
    ;; state, and the event value, and it should return the new state.
    
    (defn handle-event
      [state event]
      (if (= ::add-user (first event))
        (let [[_ name email] event]
	  (add-user state name email))))

Then you can record an event on the database like this:

    user=> (deck/record! db [::add-user "john" "john@example.com"])
    user=> (assert (= "john" (-> @db :users :john :name)))

The change happens immediately in a transaction, and is written to
disk before `record!` returns. Side note; your data file now looks like
this:

    ;; at Fri Mar 22 11:42:10 EDT 2013
    [:user/add-user "john" "john@example.com"]

You can reopen the db from disk and it will replay the events.

    user=> (def db (deck/deck {} "./datastore"))
    user=> (assert (= "john" (-> @db :users :john :name)))

## Performance

deck is not designed for truly high performance, but it does well
enough. On my 2.2 GHz i7, with a 5400 RPM hard drive, I can write
about 12K simple events/s, and replay 200K simple events/s.

deck is intended for use in situatons where your data model can fit in
memory (as an event stream and a "current" state).

In the future events could be stored and retrieved in different ways,
such as an RDBMS or HTTP.

The current implementation uses Clojure's refs and agents to handle
concurrency and serialize writes.
